# Stopwatch (developed using TDD)

##Why

To develop a stopwatch with the following functionality:
- I can press a start button, in order to start a timer
- I can press a stop button, in order to stop the timer at how much time has passed since start
- I can press a reset button, in order to stop the timer and reset the displayed time to 00:00:00:00
- I can see the timer's current time in hours, seconds, minutes and milliseconds
